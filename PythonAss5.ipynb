    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of a particular type of object.\n",
    "It serves as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class. \n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is a specific instance of a class that has its own unique state and behavior.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.\n",
    "The class that is being inherited from is called the base class, parent class, or superclass.\n",
    "The class that inherits from the base class is called the derived class, child class, or subclass.\n",
