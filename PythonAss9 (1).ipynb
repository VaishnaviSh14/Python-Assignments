    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL pronounced as “S-Q-L” or as “See-Quel” is primarily called RDBMS or Relational Databases, whereas NoSQL is a Non-relational or Distributed Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Comparing SQL vs NoSQL databases, SQL databases are table-based databases, whereas NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pairs, and graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. SQL databases have a predefined schema, whereas NoSQL databases use a dynamic schema for unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Comparing NoSQL vs SQL performance, SQL requires specialized DB hardware for better performance while NoSQL uses commodity hardware."
